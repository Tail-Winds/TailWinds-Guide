# Write

Now we're going to create or edit Quarto (.qmd) files for the desired page.

The Quarto website has [really thorough guides](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) on how to do this. Slava and I are also on call via Slack!

Generally:

1.  Click the "Pull" button in the Git tab. This will download any changes that have made to the website that you don't have.
2.  Go to File \> New File \> Quarto Document to make a new page.
3.  Write whatever you want to go on the page
4.  If you want the file to show up on the navigation bar, edit the \_quarto.yml file -- this serves as the website's map. Feel free to skip this step if you don't want people to navigate to the page just yet. This is similar to the current page you're on -- you can access directly through the URL, but not by clicking to it.
5.  Go to Build \> Preview Site. This will convert everything to HTML behind the scenes.
