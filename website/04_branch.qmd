# Branch

From [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/git-branches.html):

> Branching means that you take a detour from the main stream of development and do work without changing the main stream. It allows one or many people to work in parallel without overwriting each other's work. It allows a someone working solo to work incrementally on an experimental idea, without jeopardizing the state of the main product.

So, in order to make changes to the website that aren't ready for prime time, we want to make a branch that we can freely edit without making the whole thing come crashing down.

## Making a branch

Note that these instructions are intentionally redundant to the section on making a branch to edit the Guide. You can make a new branch either by:

1.  On GitHub, clicking the box on the top left that says "master" and typing in whatever you want to call the new branch,![](/guide/images/create_branch.png)
2.  Clicking "New Branch" in the Git pane in RStudio![](/guide/images/create_branch_rstudio.png)

If you used method #1, pull the GitHub repository. The new branch will appear on the right side of the Git pane. If you used method #2, the branch should automatically be pushed to GitHub and RStudio will switch to this branch.
