We’ve already had mild amounts of staff turnover, so the hope is that this will alleviate some of the pain associated with onboarding – or “re-onboarding” our current members after periods away from the project.\nInspired by Gavin Fay’s Lab Manual, this is a living document which everyone should be able to edit."

Note that if you’re Googling for something related to Markdown formatting, anything sold as “RMarkdown” will also work.\nAll of the different options can be confusing and create a barrier to entry. Enter: the RStudio Visual Markdown editor.\nRStudio has a visual editor for markdown documents (also called a “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” editor, or WYSIWYG, or “wizzy-wig”, how fun!). You can activate this by clicking “Visual” in the top left of your code editing pane. Now, R will act as if it were MS Word, allowing you to skip the code and add things with a few clicks. If you’re curious as to what the markdown code looks like, click “Source” and it will switch to editing as if you were a coding expert."

Then click the “Commit” button et voilà! These frozen snapshots of differences in your code or text will be stored on your computer and can be accessed later if necessary.\nFrom Happy Git:\n\nThe daily workflow is probably not dramatically different from what you do currently. You work in the usual way, writing R scripts or authoring reports in LaTeX or R Markdown. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a snapshot of all the files in the entire project. If you have ever versioned a file by adding your initials or the date, you have effectively made a commit, albeit only for a single file. It is a version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert to later. Periodically, you push commits to GitHub. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. By pushing to GitHub, you make your work and all your accumulated progress accessible to others.\n\nDon’t be afraid to “commit” changes early and often – think of these as breadcrumbs leading you back from where you came. If you’re confident you can get back there, no need to commit everything. If you’re trailblazing through uncharted territory, you probably want to commit more often."
