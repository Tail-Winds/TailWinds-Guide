This compiles everything and commits the changes to the gh-pages branch which the website uses to put the guide on the website, so don’t edit that branch.\nSo, the coarse steps are:\n\nClone the TailWinds Guide repository: https://github.com/Tail-Winds/TailWinds-Guide\nIf you’re making relatively minor changes, commit them to the master branch; it’ll wind up changing the Guide directly.\nIf you’re making substantial changes, create a new branch. You can do this either by:\n\nOn GitHub, clicking the box on the top left that says “master” and typing in whatever you want to call the new branch, or\nClicking “New Branch” in the Git pane in RStudio \n\nCommit your changes to the new branch."

If it doesn’t, let me know!\n\n2.3.1 Quarto extensions\nOkay, I got a little cute and put fun little icons linking to everyone’s various social media presence on the Team page. I’ve found out that now, because I’ve done that, everyone needs to have the cutesy little icon packages downloaded onto their computer. Don’t worry, they’re safe (and kind of neat if you want to give them a look).\n\n2.3.1.1 Font Awesome\nFont Awesome icons are just what they say they are: some awesome icons! There are literally thousands of them – go check them out. They even have a wind turbine, but you have to pay for it. 🙁\nAnyway, we need to install an extension to get them to work with Quarto. Go to Tools > Terminal > New Terminal and type:\nquarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome\nThat’s it!\n\n\n2.3.1.2 academicons\nAcademicons are the academic’s answer to Font Awesome icons.

Git can track changes in any text file, which is mostly what we use when writing code. Now, let’s consider the above process, but replacing with Git/GitHub terms:\n\nclone the repository to your computer\nedit as you see fit (with commits tracking the changes),\npull the repository to your computer to make sure that no one else has edited the repository since you last pulled\n\n(merge the files if you need to), then\n\npush your commits back to GitHub for the world to see.\n\nI suggest using RStudio, following the instructions in section 16.2.2 here . Use https://github.com/Tail-Winds/tail-winds.github.io.git as the URL for the GitHub repository.\nNow you’re good to go!"
