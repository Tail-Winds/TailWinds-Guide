Then go to Tools > Terminal >New Terminal and type\nquarto --version\nIt should return 1.2.313 or greater. If it doesn’t, let me know!\n\n1.3.1 Quarto extensions\nOkay, I got a little cute and put fun little icons linking to everyone’s various social media presence on the Team page. I’ve found out that now, because I’ve done that, everyone needs to have the cutesy little icon packages downloaded onto their computer. Don’t worry, they’re safe (and kind of neat if you want to give them a look).\n\n1.3.1.1 Font Awesome\nFont Awesome icons are just what they say they are: some awesome icons! There are literally thousands of them – go check them out. They even have a wind turbine, but you have to pay for it. 🙁\nAnyway, we need to install an extension to get them to work with Quarto. Go to Tools > Terminal > New Terminal and type:\nquarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome\nThat’s it!\n\n\n1.3.1.2 academicons\nAcademicons are the academic’s answer to Font Awesome icons. They have icons for Google Scholar, Orcid, Data Dryad, Clarivate (née Web of Science), the list goes on. To install the extension, go to Tools > Terminal > New Terminal and type:\nquarto install extension schochastics/academicons"

    "text": "Downloading the website’s source code to your computer is also known as “cloning the repository” in Git/GitHub speak.\nThink of GitHub as Google Drive and Git as the “track changes” in a Microsoft Word document. When you want to make changes to the Word doc, you:\n\ndownload it to your computer,\nedit as you see fit (with Word tracking the changes),\nmake sure that no one else has edited the document since you last downloaded it,\n\n(combine the changes if you need to), then\n\nupload the file back to Google Drive for the world to see.\n\nWe’re doing the same thing, but for code. Git can track changes in any text file, which is mostly what we use when writing code. Now, let’s consider the above process, but replacing with Git/GitHub terms:\n\nclone the repository to your computer\nedit as you see fit (with commits tracking the changes),\npull the repository to your computer to make sure that no one else has edited the repository since you last pulled\n\n(merge the files if you need to), then\n\npush your commits back to GitHub for the world to see.\n\nI suggest using RStudio, following the instructions in section 16.2.2 here . Use https://github.com/Tail-Winds/tail-winds.github.io.git as the URL for the GitHub repository.\nNow you’re good to go!"
