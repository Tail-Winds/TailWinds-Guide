    "text": "Source vs Visual editor\nA guide for the guide. Heaven help us.\nThis guide and the TailWinds website were built using Quarto and the tools provided in RStudio. You can use other tools, it’s just what we’re most familiar with, so that’s what we’ll use to walk through the larger concepts. The next sections give a general view of Quarto, Git, and YAML; these were developed by trial-and-error and a lot of failing. Hopefully we can use this as reference.\nPretty much everything you write for the Guide (and the website) will use Markdown. Some basics are outlined on the Quarto website. Note that if you’re Googling for something related to Markdown formatting, anything sold as “RMarkdown” will also work.\nAll of the different options can be confusing and create a barrier to entry. Enter: the RStudio Visual Markdown editor.\nRStudio has a visual editor for markdown documents (also called a “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” editor, or WYSIWYG, or “wizzy-wig”, how fun!). You can activate this by clicking “Visual” in the top left of your code editing pane. Now, R will act as if it were MS Word, allowing you to skip the code and add things with a few clicks. If you’re curious as to what the markdown code looks like, click “Source” and it will switch to editing as if you were a coding expert.",

Every time we apply a new argument to a YAML option, it needs to be on a new line, indented under the main argument. HTML YAML options are outlined here. Let’s assume that we want the document to be exported in HTML format. We’d write it like this:\nWhat if we want to include a table of contents? Well, that is an argument to html, so we have to now put html on a new line and indent it under format.\nExcept toc has an argument of its own – we’ll have to put that on a new line and indent it, as well.\nThere is a hierarchy in how this is implemented outlined here.

When you want to make changes to the Word doc, you:\nWe’re doing the same thing, but for code. Git can track changes in any text file, which is mostly what we use when writing code. Now, let’s consider the above process, but replacing with Git/GitHub terms:\nI suggest using RStudio, following the instructions in section 16.2.2 here . Use https://github.com/Tail-Winds/tail-winds.github.io.git as the URL for the GitHub repository.\nNow you’re good to go!\nCloning someone else’s GitHub repository is called “forking”. This makes a complete copy of the repository and places it into your GitHub account. You can then use the rest of the steps in this guide to make adjustments to their code.\nGenerally, when you wish to contribute to someone else’s package/code/repository, you:",

Then click the “Commit” button et voilà! These frozen snapshots of differences in your code or text will be stored on your computer and can be accessed later if necessary.\nFrom Happy Git:\n\nThe daily workflow is probably not dramatically different from what you do currently. You work in the usual way, writing R scripts or authoring reports in LaTeX or R Markdown. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a snapshot of all the files in the entire project. If you have ever versioned a file by adding your initials or the date, you have effectively made a commit, albeit only for a single file. It is a version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert to later. Periodically, you push commits to GitHub. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. By pushing to GitHub, you make your work and all your accumulated progress accessible to others.\n\nDon’t be afraid to “commit” changes early and often – think of these as breadcrumbs leading you back from where you came. If you’re confident you can get back there, no need to commit everything. If you’re trailblazing through uncharted territory, you probably want to commit more often.",

    "text": "24.1 “Ribbon spectrograms” and “ribbon plots”\nThe goal of this document is to recreate a few bioacoustic-y figures in R.\nThe first is a figure from a presentation entitled “Long-duration Audio-recordings of the Environment” from the Queensland University of Technology in 2017.\nA “ribbon plot” has multiple days worth of “ribbon spectrograms”; the figure below runs from day 1 at the top to day 44 at the bottom. Each ribbon is a time series (minutes, x axis) of the frequencies (Hz/kHz, y axis) of “acoustic events” (colors) that have variable amplitude (intensity of color). As an added bonus, the figure also shows sunrise/sunset (linked vertical lines) and times of high and low tides (disjointed vertical lines).\nFirst, we’ll create some dummy data from, say the month of June, 2025. We’ll have a frequency range of 1 to 50 kHz and acoustic events that range in amplitude from 1 to 153.

As a result, there’s some code we’re going to reuse a bunch that isn’t too important. We’ll use this as a base on which we’ll build the rest of the figure.\nbase_plot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~day, ncol = 1, strip.position = 'left') +\n  labs(y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'black'),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = 'black'),\n    strip.background = element_blank(),\n    strip.text.y.left = element_text(angle = 0, color = 'white'),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.spacing = unit(0, 'lines')\n  )\nBasically, facet_wrap(~day) is telling ggplot to stack what will be our “ribbon spectrograms”, by day, into the “ribbon plot”, placing the labels on the left (strip.position = 'left'). Everything else is to try and match the figure’s style.\nWe’re also going to be reusing the sunrise and sunset times, so we’ll throw that on top of our base plot.\nbase_plot &lt;- base_plot +\n  geom_vline(data = sun, aes(xintercept = sunrise_minute), color = 'yellow') +\n  geom_vline(data = sun, aes(xintercept = sunset_minute), color = 'yellow')\nHere’s what that looks like:\nbase_plot\nNow we’ll layer on our data, thinking in terms of an individual ribbon rather than the whole plot. Since there’s so much data, it’s computationally quicker to think of this as a regular raster grid with a cell height (y) of one frequency unit (Hz? kHz?) and a cell width (x) of one minute. Each cell will be colored (fill) by event and have an intensity (alpha) according to its SPL.\nbase_plot +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = spl,\n    aes(x = minute, y = freq, fill = event, alpha = spl_scaled),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  )\nDoesn’t look like much at the moment, but it’s because we used randomly-generated data that has no pattern. Hopefully it’ll be more useful when there are patterns to see.",

Seasonal changes in sunrise and sunset are shown as white and yellow dashed lines, respectively.”\n\nThis figure is similar to the above, but its “events” (species) are in separate plots rather than being over-plotted.
