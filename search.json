We’ve already had mild amounts of staff turnover, so the hope is that this will alleviate some of the pain associated with onboarding – or “re-onboarding” our current members after periods away from the project.\nInspired by Gavin Fay’s Lab Manual, this is a living document which everyone should be able to edit."

Note that if you’re Googling for something related to Markdown formatting, anything sold as “RMarkdown” will also work.\nAll of the different options can be confusing and create a barrier to entry. Enter: the RStudio Visual Markdown editor.\nRStudio has a visual editor for markdown documents (also called a “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” editor, or WYSIWYG, or “wizzy-wig”, how fun!). You can activate this by clicking “Visual” in the top left of your code editing pane. Now, R will act as if it were MS Word, allowing you to skip the code and add things with a few clicks. If you’re curious as to what the markdown code looks like, click “Source” and it will switch to editing as if you were a coding expert."

You work in the usual way, writing R scripts or authoring reports in LaTeX or R Markdown. But instead of only saving individual files, periodically you make a commit, which takes a snapshot of all the files in the entire project. If you have ever versioned a file by adding your initials or the date, you have effectively made a commit, albeit only for a single file. It is a version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert to later. Periodically, you push commits to GitHub. This is like sharing a document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. By pushing to GitHub, you make your work and all your accumulated progress accessible to others.\n\nDon’t be afraid to “commit” changes early and often – think of these as breadcrumbs leading you back from where you came. If you’re confident you can get back there, no need to commit everything. If you’re trailblazing through uncharted territory, you probably want to commit more often."

A new branch is your own little sandbox – nothing will get added to the website before it’s approved by Mike. To get that done, you need to open a pull request (next section).\nIf you get an error that looks like this…\nremote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.\nremote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.\nfatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git/'\n…you need to let GitHub know that you’re allowed to make changes to your account. Refer back to the section on installing Git."

Click it.\nThis opens a “Open a pull request” page. Go ahead and make a note about what this is going to do and click “Create pull request”.\nAt this point, you and Mike will start to have a conversation about anything that needs to be adjusted before going live on the website. Hopefully the conversation will be short, and the request can be directly merged!\nAfter thr pull request is accepted, GitHub will offer to delete the branch. As we want branches to target singular issues/tasks, it’s good to go ahead and let this happen. Don’t worry, all of the changes you’ve made are cataloged in commits, which have now been tacked onto the main branch!"

We can “prune” this branch by running the following in the Terminal, assuming that “branch-to-delete” is the name of the branch you want to delete:\ngit branch -d branch-to-delete\ngit fetch -p"
