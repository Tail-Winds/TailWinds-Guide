We’ve already had mild amounts of staff turnover, so the hope is that this will alleviate some of the pain associated with onboarding – or “re-onboarding” our current members after periods away from the project.\nInspired by Gavin Fay’s Lab Manual, this is a living document which everyone should be able to edit."

Don’t worry, they’re safe (and kind of neat if you want to give them a look).\n\n2.3.1.1 Font Awesome\nFont Awesome icons are just what they say they are: some awesome icons! There are literally thousands of them – go check them out. They even have a wind turbine, but you have to pay for it. 🙁\nAnyway, we need to install an extension to get them to work with Quarto. Go to Tools > Terminal > New Terminal and type:\nquarto install extension quarto-ext/fontawesome\nThat’s it!\n\n\n2.3.1.2 academicons\nAcademicons are the academic’s answer to Font Awesome icons.
