# Preface and Definitions {.unnumbered}

This guide is intended to be a place to host our accumulated institutional knowledge and standard operating procedures regarding the TailWinds project. We've already had mild amounts of staff turnover, so the hope is that this will alleviate some of the pain associated with onboarding -- or "re-onboarding" our current members after periods away from the project.

Inspired by [Gavin Fay's Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/), this is a living document which everyone should be able to edit.

## Hardware

C-POD

:   Recording device that consists of a hydrophone and a processor which detects "trains" of echolocation clicks from dolphins and porpoises. Operates in the 20-160 kHz range. Manufactured by [Chelonia, Ltd.](www.chelonia.co.uk). Successor to the T-POD, predecessor to the F-POD.

Delphinus

:   Server located on the UMCES-CBL campus

DMON

:   Digital acoustic monitoring instrument. Deployed on the RTWB, it is capable of recording and processing audio in near real-time using custom detection algorithms

F-POD

:   Recording device that consists of a hydrophone and a processor which detects "trains" of echolocation clicks from dolphins and porpoises. Operates in the 20-160 kHz range. Manufactured by [Chelonia, Ltd.](www.chelonia.co.uk). Successor to the C-POD.

LS1X

:   Hydrophone manufactured by [Loggerhead, Inc.](https://www.loggerhead.com/ls-recorder)

Rockhopper

:   Whale acoustic recording device, owned/operated by Cornell. Successor to the MARU devices.

VR2AR
