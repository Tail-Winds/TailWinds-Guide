# Editing

Editing the Guide follows the same steps as editing the website, outlined in the next sections. The main difference is that you don't run "render website", but instead type

`quarto publish`

into the terminal. This compiles everything and commits the changes to the `gh-pages` branch. This branch is then used to deploy the website, so don't edit that branch.

Note that `quarto publish` will publish changes from ***ANY BRANCH***, so the branching paradigm doesn't necessarily work once that command has been run.

## Guide editing workflow

1.  Clone the TailWinds Guide repository: https://github.com/Tail-Winds/TailWinds-Guide

2.  If you're making relatively minor changes, commit them to the `master` branch.

3.  If you're making substantial changes, create a new branch. You can do this either by:

    1.  On GitHub, clicking the box on the top left that says "master" and typing in whatever you want to call the new branch, or![](images/create_branch.png)

    2.  Clicking "New Branch" in the Git pane in RStudio ![](images/create_branch_rstudio.png)

4.  Preview your changes in one document by clicking "Render" in the editing pane. ![](images/render_button.png)

5.  Preview your changes to the whole document by clicking "Render Book" in the Build pane. ![](images/render_book.png)

6.  Commit your changes to your working branch.

7.  If you'd like to have your changes reviewed, push your commits to GitHub and notify the reviewer (likely Dave or Mike).

8.  If your changes are ready for prime time, enter `quarto publish` into the Terminal. ![](images/quarto_publish.png)

    It will ask you to confirm if you want to update the website version of the Guide by typing "Yes"/"y"/"Y". ![](images/quarto_publish_confirm.png)
