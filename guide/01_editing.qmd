# Editing

Editing the Guide follows the same steps as editing the website, outlined in the next sections. The main difference is that you don't run "render website", but instead type

`quarto publish`

into the terminal. This compiles everything and commits the changes to the `gh-pages` branch which the website uses to put the guide on the website, so don't edit that branch.

So, the coarse steps are:

1.  Clone the TailWinds Guide repository: https://github.com/Tail-Winds/TailWinds-Guide
2.  If you're making relatively minor changes, commit them to the `master` branch; it'll wind up changing the Guide directly.
3.  If you're making substantial changes, create a new branch. You can do this either by:
    1.   On GitHub, clicking the box on the top left that says "master" and typing in whatever you want to call the new branch, or![](images/create_branch.png)

    2.  Clicking "New Branch" in the Git pane in RStudio ![](images/create_branch_rstudio.png)
4.  Commit your changes to the new branch.
