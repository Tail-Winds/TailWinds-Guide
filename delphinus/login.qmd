# Logging in

-   If on campus connect to internet using UMCES-WiFi or CBL-ACADNET
-   If not on campus or only on UMCES-Guest log into VPN
-   Can use ACADNET or local; don't need to route all

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Command line interface (CLI)

-   Open a terminal window
    - In Windows, hit the Windows key and type "terminal". Select the terminal app.
-   "ssh" into the server:
    -   `ssh YOURUSERNAME@delphinus`
    -   Enter your password
        -   No characters will show up after `password:`
        -   as you type, just enter your password and then hit `Enter`
-   If you're on Windows and this doesn't work, you might need to [install OpenSSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)

### Bash CLI shell
If this is your first time logging in, you will probably want to switch to a "Bash" terminal. This has nifty things like coloring, copy/paste, and auto-complete. To do this:

-   Type `chsh -s /bin/bash` and hit `Enter`
-   You will be prompted to enter your password
-   Log out by typing `logout` and hit `Enter`
-   Log back in using the instructions above

## Remote Desktop

- TBD
