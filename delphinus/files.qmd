# File management

## Mapping a network drive

### Windows

-   Right click "This PC" and select "Map Network Drive"
-   Select an unused drive (D: in the picture, but it can be whichever you'd like) and enter `\\delphinus\NAMEOFSHARE` for the folder
    -   Shares are the names of the various users (`mike`/`jamie`/`kirsten`/etc) and `uswind`

-   Enter your username and ***PASSWORD REDACTED*** as the password. Click "Use a different account" if your username is pre-populated

-   You are connected!
-   If you would like to move things between shares (directories), you need to repeat this process, mounting (mapping) each directory to a differently-lettered drive

### Mac

## Moving files

### GUI (Filezilla)
-   To do

### CLI

-   `mv from/here.txt to/here.txt`

![](mv.png)

-   **WARNING!** This will automatically overwrite any existing files!
    -   Use the `-i` flag to have the system warn you before copying
    -   `mv -i from/here.txt to/here.txt`

## Uploading files

### GUI

-   To do

### CLI
-   Use the `scp` command, which stands for “secure copy protocol”. If you are “`ssh`-d” into delphinus, log out by typing `exit` and hitting `enter`; `ssh` is baked into `scp`, and they wind up not working together
-   If on Windows, type, for example:
    -   `scp C:\path\to\file.wav YOURUSERNAME@delphinus:/path/to/copy`
    -   **Note the change in slash direction!!**
    -   **Note that everything is case sensitive!!**
    -   You will be asked for your password, then files are copied (uploaded) to delphinus

-   To upload a whole folder, add `-r` after `scp` and before the file path. The `r` stands for “recursive”
    - `scp -r C:\path\to\directory YOURUSERNAME@delphinus:/path/to/copy`

## Downloading files

### GUI
-   To do

### CLI 
-   Navigate to your file’s directory and type `pwd` to find the path to your file
-   As when [uploading](#uploading-files), use the `scp` command, which stands for “secure copy protocol”. If you are “`ssh`-d” into delphinus, log out by typing `exit` and hitting `enter`; `ssh` is baked into `scp`, and they wind up not working together.
-   If on Windows, type:
    -   `scp YOURUSERNAME@delphinus:/path/to/filename.docx C:\path\to\copy`
    -   **Note the change in slash direction!!**
    -   **Note that everything is case sensitive!!**
    -   You will be asked for your password, then files are copied (downloaded) to your computer
