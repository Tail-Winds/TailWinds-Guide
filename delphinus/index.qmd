## Command line interface (CLI)

As delphinus is running Ubuntu, which is a Linux operating system, everything can be done via the command line, or terminal. There is a steep learning curve here, but it is very fast as resources are not used running a graphical user interface (GUI).

Information in further chapters in this section will be provided both for those using a GUI or the CLI.
